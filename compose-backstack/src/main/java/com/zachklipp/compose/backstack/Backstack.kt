/**
 * Renders the top of a stack of screens (as [T]s) and animates between screens when the top
 * value changes. Any state used by a screen will be preserved as long as it remains in the stack
 * (i.e. result of [remember] or [state] calls).
 *
 * The [backstack] must follow some rules:
 *  - Must always contain at least one item.
 *  - Elements in the stack must implement `equals` and not change over the lifetime of the screen.
 *    If the key changes, it will be considered a new screen and any state held by the screen will
 *    be lost.
 *  - If items in the stack are reordered between compositions, the stack should not contain
 *    duplicates. If it does, due to how `@Pivotal` works, the states of those screens will be
 *    lost if they are moved around. If the list contains duplicates, an [IllegalArgumentException]
 *    will be thrown.
 *
 * This composable does not actually provide any navigation functionality â€“ it just renders
 * transitions between stacks of screens. It can be plugged into your navigation library of choice,
 * or just used on its own with a simple list of screens.
 *
 * ## Instance state caching
 *
 * Screens that contain persistable state using the (i.e. via
 * [savedInstanceState][androidx.ui.savedinstancestate.savedInstanceState]) will automatically have
 * that state saved when they are hidden, and restored the next time they're shown.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * sealed class Screen {
 *   object ContactList: Screen()
 *   data class ContactDetails(val id: String): Screen()
 *   data class EditContact(val id: String): Screen()
 * }
 *
 * data class Navigator(
 *   val push: (Screen) -> Unit,
 *   val pop: () -> Unit
 * )
 *
 * @Composable fun App() {
 *   var backstack by state { listOf(Screen.ContactList) }
 *   val navigator = remember {
 *     Navigator(
 *       push = { backstack += it },
 *       pop = { backstack = backstack.dropLast(1) }
 *     )
 *   }
 *
 *   Backstack(backstack) { screen ->
 *     when(screen) {
 *       Screen.ContactList -> ShowContactList(navigator)
 *       is Screen.ContactDetails -> ShowContact(screen.id, navigator)
 *       is Screen.EditContact -> ShowEditContact(screen.id, navigator)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param backstack The stack of screen values.
 * @param modifier [Modifier] that will be applied to the container of screens. Neither affects nor
 * is affected by transition animations.
 * @param transition The [BackstackTransition] that defines how to animate between screens when
 * [backstack] changes. [BackstackTransition] contains a few simple pre-fab transitions.
 * @param animationBuilder Defines the curve and speed of transition animations.
 * @param onTransitionStarting Callback that will be invoked before starting each transition.
 * @param onTransitionFinished Callback that will be invoked after each transition finishes.
 * @param inspectionParams Optional [InspectionParams] that, when not null, enables inspection mode,
 * which will draw all the screens in the backstack as a translucent 3D stack. You can wrap your
 * backstack with [InspectionGestureDetector] to automatically generate [InspectionParams]
 * controlled by touch gestures.
 * @param drawScreen Called with each element of [backstack] to render it.
